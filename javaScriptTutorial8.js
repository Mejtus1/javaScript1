// you dont want to usually declare variable 2 times

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------//
//another useful thing is to "use strict" = a lot of people use it 
//on top of a file or at the beginning of the function 
// to catch a coding mistakes such as not declaring a variable

var = //declared globally, we can access it even outside of functions it was declared in 
let = //declaerd inside a expression scope it was set within 
//let is used because we make sure the variable is defined only inside a scope it is defined in



//Const keyword = a read only variable 
//it has all the features of let but it is read only, it cannot be reasigned 

const

    s[1] = 5;
    s[2] = 7;
}
editInPlace();
//when we console.log it out we should see the new array [2, 5, 7]



//Prevent object mutation (we can still mutate data or object even when its declared with const )
