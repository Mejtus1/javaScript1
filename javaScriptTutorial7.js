//LOOPS 
//Iterate with while loop
    //loops allow you to run a code for a multiple times
    var myArray = [];

    var i = 0;
    while(i < 5) {
        myArray.push(i); 
        i++;
    }

    console.log(myArray);



//Iterate with for loops
var ourArray = [];
// for loop is most common type of loop in javascript 
for (var g = 0; g < 5; g++) {// we start by for and than there are 3 different values separated by semicolon 
ourArray.push(i);
}
var myArray = [];
//initialization is in for loop var (g = 0;) = most for loops start by initializing variable 
//the next thing is the CONDITION = (g < 5) (once is evaulates to false) 
// (i++) the end of each itteration, we increment g by 1



//Iterate odd numbers with a for loop
